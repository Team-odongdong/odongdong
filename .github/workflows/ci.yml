# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run

on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "Develop" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "feature/*", "bugfix/*" ]

# pull_request:

# branches: [ "main" ]

# Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

jobs:

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

  test: # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
